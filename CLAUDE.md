# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

A static portfolio site ("what does a tree smell like") — hand-written HTML, one shared
stylesheet, plain browser JS. No build step, no package manager, no local dependencies:
Three.js r128 comes from a CDN in `index.html` alone, fonts from Google Fonts. Deployed
via GitHub Pages from the repo root, so the default branch is the live site.

## Running it

Serve over HTTP rather than opening files directly — pages use relative asset paths and
pointer machinery (`document.elementFromPoint`) that misbehaves on `file://`:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000    # then open http://localhost:8000/
```

There are no tests, linters, or build commands; verification is visual. When changing
`node-scene.js`, `paper.js`, or `thread.js`, check the browser console first — the
particle systems use a custom shader, and a shader that fails to compile takes the whole
3D scene with it, so the map comes up blank rather than merely wrong.

Two states are easy to forget when reviewing a change:

- **`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`** — read by `landing.js`, `paper.js`, `thread.js`,
  `node-scene.js`, and `style.css`, each degrading to a still version. `nav.js` (the
  cursor) and `extras.js` do *not* currently check it; if you add motion there, add the
  guard too.
- **Portrait / narrow viewport** — `resize()` in `node-scene.js` uses a larger `frameH`
  when `aspect < 1`, deliberately drawing the map smaller so the left and right link
  nodes stay on screen and tappable. Vertical swipes must keep scrolling the page;
  only horizontal drags rotate the map.

## Architecture

### Page shell (every page)

Each HTML page is standalone and repeats the same head block (charset, viewport, the two
Google Fonts, `style.css`). At the bottom, every page sets `window.SITE_ROOT` before
loading `nav.js`:

```html
<script>window.SITE_ROOT = "";</script>      <!-- root pages -->
<script>window.SITE_ROOT = "../";</script>   <!-- categories/ and works/ -->
```

`nav.js` prefixes every menu link with it, so getting this wrong on a new page breaks
the entire menu rather than one link. `nav.js` also builds the custom cursor — that's
why it loads on every page, not just the landing page.

`SITE_LINKS` at the top of `nav.js` is the only definition of the menu.

### The landing page's layers

`index.html` is three scroll-snapped slides with six scripts over them, loaded in
dependency order: `nav.js`, `landing.js`, `node-scene.js`, `paper.js`, `thread.js`,
`extras.js`. Each owns one visual system, and they communicate *only* through three
globals:

| global | written by | read by |
|---|---|---|
| `__p23` | `paper.js` (0–1 scroll progress, slide 2 → 3) | `node-scene.js` (map fade-in), `thread.js` |
| `__mapField` | `node-scene.js`, per frame (screen position + mass of centre and nodes) | `paper.js`, to bend the grid around the diagram |
| `__mapReadout` | `node-scene.js`, per frame | `extras.js`, to place its overlays |

That table is the whole contract; these files deliberately never touch each other's DOM
or internals. (The README says `thread.js` sets `__p23` — it doesn't, `paper.js` does.)

- **`landing.js`** — hand-animates `scrollTop` between slides (wheel, keys, the "Scroll"
  button). It must set `scroll-snap-type: none` for the duration of each animation and
  restore it on landing; leaving snap on makes the browser fight the animation, which is
  what previously looked broken.
- **`paper.js`** — the wash, the bending squared-paper grid, and the static, drawn on
  canvases at throttled rates (`GRID_MS`, `NOISE_MS`) rather than every frame.
- **`thread.js`** — the line running down all three slides. `TRANSITION` at the top
  selects between two finished treatments of its final leg (`"dissolve"` / `"fork"`);
  both are maintained, so keep both working.
- **`extras.js`** — optional furniture around the map, switched by the `EXTRAS` object
  (`dimensions` / `orthographics` / `chromatogram`). Nothing depends on it; the file and
  its `<script>` tag can be deleted with no other change.

### `node-scene.js` — the 3D map

The one genuinely complex file (~1200 lines). Two lists at the top are the intended edit
surface; everything below is graphics code.

- **`REAL_NODES`** — the clickable endpoints: `label`, `sub`, `href`, `pos: [x, y, z]`,
  plus an optional `preview: { description }`. Positions are a Fibonacci sphere. Keep
  `pos` roughly 3.2–3.7 from the origin, and keep `y` clear of 0 — a node near the
  equator sweeps across the middle of the screen on every rotation, dragging its label
  through the centre.
- **`ATMOSPHERE_LABELS`** — faint non-clickable words floating in the map.

Everything else is derived, and that is the property to preserve. Each branch is a
`CatmullRomCurve3` from the hub through two waypoints to the node, with the waypoints
computed from the node's own position and a per-branch perpendicular. The branch stops
at the node — nothing continues past a link node, so anything clickable reads as a place
the map *ends*. Its wake specks are sampled off that same curve (`curve.getPoint(t)`),
which is why they can't end up lopsided and why they ride the branch's motion with it.
Move a node and the curve, waypoints, and wake all follow; don't hand-place any of it.

Note the README documents a `DECORATIVE_POINTS` list and a `MAX_LOOSE_REACH` tuning
value for loose dots that attach to the nearest waypoint. **Neither exists in the code
any more** — that system was replaced by the per-branch wake described above.

Other things that will bite you:

- Both particle systems are single batched draws with a custom `ShaderMaterial` giving
  every speck its own size and opacity (the stock points material can do neither). This
  is what makes hundreds of specks cheap, and it's why a shader error blanks the scene.
- A wake speck is `PARTICLES_PER_SPECK` (9) particles stacked on one point, so it reads
  as a single dot at rest and sprays apart when pointed at. Spray directions are fixed
  at load, so a given speck always bursts the same way.
- Hover detection raycasts against `wake.points`, not the branches — pointing at a
  speck is what sets `activeBranch`. Emphasis is then by **weight, not colour**: the
  branch thickens, the rest of the map steps back. Branches are tubes rather than lines
  precisely so they *can* thicken, since WebGL ignores line width nearly everywhere.
- Hovering a node, or having a preview open, holds the map still instead of letting it
  keep drifting under the pointer.
- A node's `preview` intercepts the click and opens a dark modal whose connector arm is
  that node's *own* branch traced out to the window, not a second curve drawn alongside.
- If `THREE` is undefined the scene replaces itself with a plain list of `REAL_NODES`
  links. Keep that fallback working when editing the top of the file.
- The `TUNING` block near the top holds every magic number (`IDLE_SPEED`, `FRAME_V` /
  `FRAME_H` — larger values draw the map *smaller* — `BRANCH_RADIUS`, `SPECK_SIZE`,
  `REF_PX_PER_UNIT`, and the wake / cloud / corrugation groups). Tune there, not inline.
  Several systems are dialled to zero but left wired up (`SWAY = 0`, `CLOUD_COUNT = 0`);
  bring them back by raising the number rather than rebuilding the machinery.

### Styling

`style.css` is the only stylesheet, in commented sections mirroring the page types. Six
design tokens at the top (`--bg`, `--bg-2`, `--line`, `--ink`, `--muted`, `--brass`) plus
`--sans` / `--mono`. The palette is **light** — near-white ground, near-black ink, one
brass accent; the README still describes an earlier near-black-background version, so
trust the CSS.

Any full-bleed dark region must carry the `dark-surface` class. `nav.js`'s cursor checks
what is under the pointer on every move and switches to a light colour over anything so
tagged; an untagged dark panel gets an invisible cursor. It falls back to computing
background luminance, but the class is the reliable path.

## Content conventions

- **New piece of work**: duplicate a template in `works/` — `example-gallery-work.html`
  for image-and-paragraph sequences, `example-article-work.html` for reference pieces —
  then add an `<a class="work-row">` block to the relevant `categories/` page, copying
  the pattern in `categories/scent-descriptions.html` (the only filled-in category).
- **New category**: duplicate any `categories/` page, change its `<h1>` and lede, add a
  line to `SITE_LINKS` in `nav.js`, and optionally add a `REAL_NODES` entry so it also
  appears in the map.
- Images live in `images/`, referenced from the `<img>` tags left commented out in the
  templates.
- `works/test-node-a.html` / `test-node-b.html` are sandbox pages reached from the two
  "Test node" entries in `REAL_NODES`; safe to repurpose or delete together.
- The HTML comments inside each template say which block to copy for another entry —
  they are the site's real documentation for its author. Keep them accurate when
  changing a template's structure.
- Placeholder content is still in place in several spots (`Your Name`,
  `you@example.com`, the lorem ipsum on slide 2, the `contact.html` social links). Don't
  "fix" these incidentally; they're the author's decisions to make.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file current: when the `window` contract, the landing page's layer list, the
`node-scene.js` data lists, or the content workflow changes, update the matching section
in the same commit.

`README.md` is a running changelog written for the site's author and has drifted in
several places (`__p23`'s owner, the palette, `DECORATIVE_POINTS`). Prefer the code
whenever they disagree, and correct this file rather than trusting either.
